# D&D 5e Utilities

This extension is a mish-mash of utilities that I use to make VS Code into my DM Notebook for my D&D 5e games. 

## Features

Currently the features are:
 - An NPC sheet viewer based on JSON character/monster data
 - My preferred markdown styling for my session notes


## Release Notes

### 0.1.0

Initial release! Added the NPC sheet viewer and my markdown styling.
